<h1>Some indirect consequences of overpackaging:</h1>
<p>1. Many plastic materials cannot be effectively recycled and degraded, resulting in the destruction of land and marine ecosystems</p>
<p>2. The large carbon emissions from packaging pose a challenge to climate change</p>
<p>3. Waste of human resources from handling a large amount of waste sorting</p>
<p>4. Packaging waste is put into the ocean, causing microplastic pollution and posing a threat to human health</p>
<p>5. The deforestation of trees poses a threat to the terrestrial ecosystem</p>
