<h1>Some indirect consequences of overpackaging:</h1>
<h4>1. Many plastic materials cannot be effectively recycled and degraded, resulting in the destruction of land and marine ecosystems</h4>
<h4>2. The large carbon emissions from packaging pose a challenge to climate change</h4>
<h4>3. Waste of human resources from handling a large amount of waste sorting</h4>
<h4>4. Packaging waste is put into the ocean, causing microplastic pollution and posing a threat to human health</h4>
<h4>5. The deforestation of trees poses a threat to the terrestrial ecosystem</h4>
