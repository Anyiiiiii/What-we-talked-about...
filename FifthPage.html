<title>Fifth Package</title>

<h1>A personal experience</h1>
<p>I once bought a kind of oranges in a supermarket, the variety was Red Beauty, and the price for one was over ten dollars. When I chose to buy it, the sales said it needed to be packaged, and then she took out a huge leather case that looked like it contained wine, put a few oranges into the cushioned plastic packaging, and then pressed the packaging into this leather case. This process was a shock to me, and since then, I have chosen to bring my own canvas bags to purchase fruits and vegetables.</p>
